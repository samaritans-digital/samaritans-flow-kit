Samaritans Flow Kit
==================

This is a kit of common user interface elements intended to quickly prototype digital services using [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/).

It's designed to show the flows users might take through a service, rather than the detailed visual design of particular webpages.

It's also meant to show front-end experience only, rather than show back office processes or implementation detail.

It's inspired by the [GOV.UK flow kit](https://github.com/charlesrt/gov-flow) and supports Sketch v47.1 and up.
