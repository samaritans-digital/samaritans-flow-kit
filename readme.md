Samaritans Flow Kit
==================

This is a kit of common user interface elements intended to quickly prototype digital services using [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/).

It's not designed to show the detail or visual design of a particular webpage, but rather to show the flows users might take through a service.

It's inspired by (https://github.com/charlesrt/gov-flow) and supports Sketch v47.1 and up.
